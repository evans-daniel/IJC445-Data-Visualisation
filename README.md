# IJC445-Data-Visualisation


This is the repository for my IJC445 Data Visualisation Module. The full report is not availabe publically for this, however here is the code for the project figures. It uses the same dataset as the Introduction to Data Science project (also available on my Github), and so uses the same data importing script.

The aim of this project was to examine the ORR's Public Performance Measure (PPM)'s behaviour over time and its associations via data visualisations. Visualisations were built using frameworks such as ASSERT and the grammar of graphics with accessibility in mind.
